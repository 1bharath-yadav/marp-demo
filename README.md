Seaborn Heatmap Demo

Contact: 24f1001694@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

This repository contains a small demo that generates a professional Seaborn heatmap (customer engagement by hour and day) and exports it as a 512x512 PNG.

Files:
- chart.py : Python script that generates `chart.png` using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- chart.png : Generated 512x512 PNG heatmap (created by running `chart.py`).
